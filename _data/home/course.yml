- p: <p>This graduate course will serve as an introductory robotics course for students with little/no background in mechanical systems. 
      </p>
- p: <p>The course will first build the necessary mathematical framework in which to understand topics such as center of gravity and moment of inertia, friction, statics of rigid bodies, principle of virtual work, kinematics of particles and rigid bodies, impacts, Newtonian and Lagrangian mechanics, rigid body transformations, forward and inverse kinematics, forward and inverse dynamics, state space representations. Towards the end of the course advanced topics such as rigid body collisions, and hybrid dynamical systems will also be covered.</p>
